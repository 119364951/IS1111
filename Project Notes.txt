Passing arguments into Parameters can be tricky.

Parameters can have the same names as the arguments or they might have different names.

For instance

X = "VB"

Call Language (X)

 >>> X = VB here in the argument

 

Sub Language (Y as String)

>>Arguments are passed into paramters

>>Our parameter has a different name to the argument. Previously it was X; now it is Y. It still holds the value "VB" even though the name changed.

lstbox.Items.Add(Y " is the programming language I am using now") >>Anywhere Y appears now, the value "VB" will be shown.

End Sub

 

Now - in the example covered online:

Wordplay(B)

 >>> B = At this stage, B is Yvonne

 

Sub Wordplay (ByVal X As String)

>>Arguments are passed into paramters

>>Our parameter has a different name to the argument. Previously it was B; now it is X. It still holds the value "Yvonne" even though the name changed.

>> Anywhere now that X is referenced you say Yvonne instead.

End Sub
